# Lab 4 Reflection and Observations

* Lorenz Alvin Tubo
* Fausto Javier Zaruma
* Harsh Lodhi

## Simple sorts

	* which algorithm did you find easiest to understand?
	Selection sort.
	* which algorithm seemed to fastest for completing the sort?
	Selection sort. 
	-This maybe a biased choice based on the understanding of the concept by different participants.


## Merging Unsorted lists

	* how long did this take
	5mins. 54secs. (due to the large scope of data.)
	* did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
	We had incurred multiple errors due to participant attempting to improve efficiency, which caused multiple errors.
		* How many times?
		5 mistakes. 


## Merging Sorted lists

	* how long did this take
	1min 5secs. Substancial difference
	* did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
	Yes but the errors incurred were fewer compared to the unsorted list.
		* How many times?
		2 Errors.

## Sorting larger data sets

|Team member | Sorting time|
|---|---|
| Lorenz Alvin Tubo | 01:04 |
| Fausto Javier Zaruma | 2:12 |
| Harsh Lodhi | 1:20 |

What was fastest time?
Lorenz Alvin Tubo 1min 4secs.

Describe the algorithm produced by the team member with fastest time.
Selection Sort.

## Partitioning

* how long did it take to partition the data set?
7mins 25 secs.

## Sorting the small piles

* how long did it take for you to sort all of the little piles?
5mins 29secs. Suggesting it took around 70% of overall time allocation. due to the repetative partitioning of data.

## Putting it together

* As a team discuss things that helped sort the papers... what was useful? what was fast to do?  What was slow?
Any process that involved small fast operations multiple times was easiuer than an entire process taking up an entire logic. Also data size would impact the time at a resonable rate.
* As a team come up with a description of how best to sort a set of numbers on paper.
Picking the numbers from a list and adding them based on the smallest value until all values are done. Initially, it takes a substantial amount of time but as it progresses the scope slowly decreases as the papers that are unsorted become less common. Selection Sort. 
* Mix up all your numbers and have each member of the team perform the sort you did.  How long did it take?
The speed of sorting was close to the same, considering the difference in time was due to the randomization of the data. Also the participants understanding of the sorting algorithm.
