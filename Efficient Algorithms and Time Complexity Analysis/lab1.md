# Reflection for Lab 1

What did you like/not like about Python?
Personally I find python easier to understand compared to previous programming languages we used in previous 
semesters C++, Javascript (to name a few). Although this might sound as a good thing it also comes with its 
downsides I actually miss the curly brackets separating a codeblock from the entirity of a code. Or the 
paranthesis for a condition in an if statement. or even the ';' when you end a code line. I will further try 
to familirize myself with these new functionalities/changes/differences in code writing in python compared to 
other languages.

Was there anything that behaved differently than you expected in python?
I had this error while coding saying 'Inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation, I believe because of 
the lack of ';' or '{}' i couldnt quite get used to how a code block would end or start but further scanning or 
debugging of the code should give fruitful results regarding my errors.

Based on what you wrote in your lab, write something about the similarities and differences between Python with 
C/C++ and how that affects how you write your program?
The conditions are technically the same except we used 'and' instead of '&&' most of the comparison operators 
were the same. although creating member variables required __init__(self): self.variable_name etc.. and not 
just creating them inside of the class with their variable names. 

Side Note:
I left comments in the py code regarding what is happening under the hood of the functions/classes.
